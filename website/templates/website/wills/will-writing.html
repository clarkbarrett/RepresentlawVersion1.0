        <h2>About the National Renters Alliance</h2>
        <p> The National Renters Alliance was established to help renters with tenancy problems caused by unscrupulous
          landlords and letting agents. This includes help recovering money unfairly taken from deposits, negotiating
          with landlords about housing repairs and other common renting problems.
        </p>

      <p>With the intensification of the housing crisis which is decades in the making, more and more people are
        forced to rent rather than buy their own homes. This situation is set to get worse as new house building has
        massively failed to keep pace with increases in the UK's population and the movement of young people to large
        cities. The expansion of buy-to-let landlords and rampant property speculation has pushed house prices beyond
        the reach of most people under the age of thirty-five. This situation is increasingly being exploited by bad
        landlords and letting agents who often invent spurious reasons to take money from deposits or avoid their
        repairing responsibilities.
      </p>

      <p> The National Renters Alliance is here to help you, whether it be getting your deposit back if it was unfairly
        taken from you, to forcing landlords and letting agents to do repairs which they are eligible for which you pay
        them to do through your rent. If you are renting, join us today and see how the National Renters Alliance can
        help you to take the stress out of renting.
