    <h2>Make sure you report repairs</h2>
        <p>There are various options for action to take against a landlord who doesn't do
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-landlord_and_tenant_responsibilities_for_repairs' %}"
               title="see also: landlord and tenant responsibilities for repair">repairs they are responsible for</a>.</p>
        <p>Before you consider further action, make sure you have reported the repair problems to your landlord and given
            them a reasonable time to start and finish the work.</p>
        <p>Landlords are usually only responsible for doing repairs they've been told about.</p>

    <h2>Negotiate with your landlord or letting agent</h2>
        <p>It's often easier to get things done through negotiation.</p>
        <p>You could send a reminder letter or phone your landlord or letting agent to check if
            they received your original request for repairs.</p>
        <p>If a letting agent manages repairs on behalf of your landlord but isn't dealing with the repairs,
            you can use their complaints procedure. This may prompt them to arrange the repairs.</p>
        <p>You can complain to their letting agent redress scheme if you don't get a satisfactory response
            or the letting agents don't reply. You can still pursue other options.</p>

    <h2>Complain to environmental health</h2>
        <p>If your landlord won't do repairs and this affects your health and safety in your home, you
            can ask your local council to visit to inspect the condition of your home.</p>
        <p>The council should be able to offer help and advice and may tell the landlord to do repairs.</p>
        <p>You usually need to contact the environmental health team or the private renting team at your council.</p>
