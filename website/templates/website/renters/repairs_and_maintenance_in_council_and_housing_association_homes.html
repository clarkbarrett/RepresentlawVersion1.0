        <h2>Conditions when you move in</h2>
        <p>When you move into a council or housing association home:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>it should be clean and fit to live in</li>
            <li>any necessary repairs should be completed</li>
            <li>gas and electrical supplies and all plumbing should be safe and working</li>
            <li>windows and doors should be secure and work properly</li>
            <li>the garden should be free from rubbish</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">
            If there are no working smoke alarms in your new home, ask your landlord if they can supply and fit them.</p>
        <h3>Domestic appliances, furniture and carpets</h3>
        <p>Most council or housing association homes are unfurnished. You are usually expected to provide your own
            appliances, furniture, carpets and other floor coverings.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for repairing and replacing these.</p>
        <p>There are usually connections for a washing machine, fridge and cooker.</p>

          {% include 'disrepair-callout.html' %}


    <h2>Repairs your landlord is responsible for</h2>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for repairs to:</p>
        <ul><li>the structure and exterior of the building &ndash; including the roof, walls,
            windows and external doors</li>
            <li>central heating, gas fires, fireplaces, flues, ventilation and chimneys</li>
            <li>water, pipes, basins, sinks, toilets and baths</li>
            <li>drains and guttering</li>
            <li>gas pipes, electrical wiring and any appliances provided</li>
            <li>common parts such as lifts and communal entrances</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your tenancy agreement might set out any other responsibilities the council or housing
            association has.</p>

                landlords' responsibilities for repairs</a>.</p>

    <h3>How to report repair problems</h3>
        <p>Councils and housing associations should have a system for reporting and dealing with repairs.
            They should give you information about this at the start of your tenancy.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">Find out

          {% include 'disrepair-callout.html' %}

    <h3>How long repairs should take</h3>
        <p>After you report a repair problem, your landlord should tell you how they are
            going to deal with it and how long it is likely to take.</p>
        <p>Your tenants' handbook or tenancy agreement may tell you how long a particular type of repair
            should take to be fixed.</p>
        <p>For council tenants, some small repairs may be covered by the
            <a title="See also: Right to repair for council tenants"

        <p>Contact your landlord again if they take too long to start repairs or don't keep to their own
            agreements for what should be repaired.</p>
        <p>For example, if your landlord says that you have to pay to redecorate your home after damage
            caused by disrepair, but this is one of their repair responsibilities.</p>

                what to do if your landlord won't do repairs</a>.</p>
    <h2>Accidental or deliberate damage</h2>
        <p>Landlords are not required to fix any damage caused by tenants or their guests or visitors.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">If your landlord does fix damage you're responsible for,
            they will usually charge you for this.</p>

    <h2>Problems during repairs by your landlord</h2>
        <p>If your home is damaged by repair or maintenance work organised by your landlord, they should fix it.</p>
        <p>This includes redecorating if disrepair or repair work caused damage.</p>
        <p>You can ask for a rent reduction if you can't use all or part of your home because of repair work.</p>
        <p>If your landlord refuses to reduce the rent, you could

    <h2>If your landlord doesn't do repairs</h2>
        <p>Contact your landlord again if they take too long to start repairs or don't keep to their
            own agreements for what should be repaired.</p>

    <h2>Health and safety standards</h2>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">
            Your home must be safe and fit to live in when your tenancy starts and throughout your tenancy.</p>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for:</p>

          {% include 'disrepair-callout.html' %}

    <h2>Common areas</h2>
        <p>Common areas are those shared with other people, such as hallways, stairs or lifts in the building.</p>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for the repair and decoration of these areas. This applies
            even if your tenancy agreement says you have to help keep common areas clean and tidy.</p>

    <h2>Gardens and outside spaces</h2>
        <p>It's usually a tenant's responsibility to take care of their garden. This means you should keep
            it reasonably tidy. It doesn't mean that you have to improve the garden.</p>
        <p>Ask your landlord for permission if you want to make any changes to your garden, such as building
            a shed or laying a patio.</p>
        <p>If your tenancy agreement doesn't say anything about the garden, then you are expected to
            at least keep it in the condition it was in when you moved in.</p>
        <p>Where the garden is shared with other tenants, either your landlord may be responsible for
            maintaining it or you'll share responsibility with the other tenants.</p>

    <h2>Decorating and home improvements</h2>
        <p>You usually need your landlord's permission to make your own improvements to a council
            or housing association home.</p>
        <p>Home improvements could include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a shower if your home doesn't have one</li>
            <li>new kitchen units</li>
            <li>a gas fire</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Improvements could also include decorating the outside of the house, putting up a greenhouse
            or shed or building an extension.</p>
        <p>Council tenants may be able to apply for compensation for certain improvements at the end of their tenancy.
            Contact your council's housing department for more information.</p>

    <h3>Decorating your home</h3>
        <p>Tenants are usually responsible for decorating a council or housing association home.</p>
        <p>Your landlord could be responsible for redecoration:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>if damp or disrepair damaged your home</li>
            <li>following
                <a href="{% url 'website:renters-problems_during_council_or_housing_association_repairs' %}"

                    damage caused by repair work</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ask your landlord to pay something towards redecoration costs if the property is in a poor state of
            decoration when you start your tenancy.</p>
        <p>Some councils and housing associations provide decoration vouchers which can be used to buy
            decorating materials in local DIY stores.</p>
