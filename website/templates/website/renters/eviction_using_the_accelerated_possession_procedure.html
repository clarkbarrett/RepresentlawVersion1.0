    <h2>What is the accelerated possession procedure?</h2>
        <p>Some private landlords can apply to a county court for a court order to evict tenants without the need for a court hearing.
            This quicker route to eviction is called the accelerated possession procedure.</p>
        <p>The landlord cannot use the accelerated possession procedure to claim for any rent that is owed.</p>
        <p>Your landlord can only use the accelerated possession procedure if you are an assured shorthold
            tenant and you were given a written tenancy agreement when you first moved in.</p>
        <p>It can only be used if your landlord has served a&nbsp;

               href="{% url 'website:renters-section_21_eviction_process' %}">valid Section 21 notice</a>.</p>

    <h2>What your landlord has to do</h2>
        <p>To use the accelerated possession procedure, your landlord must apply to the court by completing possession
            claim form N5B and send it to the court with the evidence needed.</p>
        <p>The evidence your landlord sends to the court must include copies of all the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your original tenancy agreement</li>
            <li>your latest tenancy agreement if it is different to the original</li>
            <li>the Section 21 notice they gave you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your landlord also has to pay a fee to the court.</p>

        <h2>What the court sends you</h2>
        <p>After the landlord applies to the court, the court sends you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a copy of the landlord's claim form and copies of documents</li>
            <li>a defence or reply form (Form N11B)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>What might prevent the eviction</h2>
        <p>Reasons your landlord shouldn't be able to evict you could include if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the landlord failed to&nbsp;

    <h2>How to defend the case or delay eviction</h2>
        <p>You only have 14 days to complete and return the defence form to the court.</p>
        <p>Use the defence form to tell the court if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you disagree with anything that your landlord has set out on the claim form</li>
            <li>there is a reason why your landlord can't evict you</li>
            <li>you want to delay the eviction date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can ask the court to delay the eviction, even if you don't want to defend the case.
            You can ask for a delay of no more than 42 days.</p>
        <p>The court sets a date for a hearing, unless you say on the reply form that you are willing for the
            court to make a decision without a hearing.</p>
        <p>The court considers the landlord's claim form, the evidence they provide and your defence form.</p>

    <h2>If the court decides a hearing is needed</h2>
        <p>The court sets a date for a hearing so you can go to court to argue your case.</p>
