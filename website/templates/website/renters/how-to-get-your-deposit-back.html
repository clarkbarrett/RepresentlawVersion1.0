        <h2>1. Ask for your deposit back</h2>
            <p>A tenancy deposit is money you pay to a landlord in case you leave and owe rent or cause damage to
                the property.&nbsp;</p>

                your landlord must protect your deposit in a tenancy deposit scheme.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Write to your landlord</h3>
            <p>Your landlord should return your deposit in full at the end of your tenancy unless they are entitled
                to keep it or make deductions due to rent arrears, damage or other financial loss caused by you.</p>

            <p>Send a letter or email to&nbsp;your landlord or agent&nbsp;to ask for it back.</p>


            <h3>Deposits protected in an insurance-based scheme</h3>

            <p>You can notify the scheme if your landlord doesn't return your deposit within 10
                days of your written request.</p>
            <p>The scheme will order the landlord to pay the disputed amount to them and hold the deposit
                until the dispute is resolved by:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>agreement with your landlord</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Deposits protected in a custodial scheme&nbsp;</h3>

            <p>You should ask a custodial scheme to refund your deposit at the end of your tenancy.</p>
            <p>The scheme must refund your money within 10 days if you and your landlord agree.</p>
            <p>If your landlord doesn't agree to the refund, the custodial scheme holds the money until the dispute
                is resolved by the scheme's dispute resolution service or by the court.</p>
            <p>A custodial scheme can return your deposit without you going to court if your tenancy has ended
                and you have no contact details for your landlord or you have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>written to your landlord to request return of your deposit</li>

                <h3>Use a tenancy deposit scheme's dispute resolution service</h3>
                <p>Your landlord should have used a tenancy deposit protection scheme to protect your tenancy deposit
                    if you are an&nbsp;

                </p>
                <p>The scheme's alternative dispute resolution (ADR) service can help if there's a dispute about the
                    return of your tenancy deposit.&nbsp;You can only use ADR if both you and your landlord
                    agree.&nbsp;The service is free.</p>
                <p>The ADR service decides how much of your deposit should be returned to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
                    decision is final.</p>

                <p>Contact the tenancy deposit protection scheme to find out more about their ADR service:</p>

                <p>A tenancy deposit protection scheme's ADR service can only deal with whether your tenancy
                    deposit should be returned to you in full or in part. It can't award you compensation,
                    but you can consider separate court action for this.</p>
                <p>If you are not sure if your tenancy deposit was protected, you can check online.</p>

                </p>

             <h2>3. Consider court action</h2>

                <p>You may be able to take court action if your landlord refuses to return all or part of your deposit.
                    Court action should be a last resort.</p>
                <p>You can use a tenancy deposit protection scheme's alternative dispute resolution (ADR)&nbsp;service
                    to resolve a dispute instead of going to court.&nbsp;You can only use this if you have an assured
                    shorthold tenancy and your landlord used a tenancy deposit protection scheme to protect your
                    deposit.&nbsp;There is no cost to you or your landlord. Their decision is final.</p>
                <p>The first step in taking court action is to send your landlord a formal letter called a letter
                    before action. This sets out the details of the case against your landlord, including any claim
                    for compensation.&nbsp;It's worth sending a letter before action even if you don't like the idea
                    of going to court. Your landlord may offer to settle the dispute rather than face a court hearing.</p>

             <h3>Court action if your tenancy deposit was protected</h3>

                <p>You can take your landlord to court for a refund of your tenancy deposit if you are an assured
                    shorthold tenant and your landlord:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>protected your deposit with a tenancy deposit protection scheme</li>
                    <li>won't agree to use the scheme's ADR service</li>
