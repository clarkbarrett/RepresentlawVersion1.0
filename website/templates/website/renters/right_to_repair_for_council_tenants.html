    <h2>Eligible repairs</h2>
        <p>The right to repair scheme can help council tenants to get minor repairs fixed quickly.</p>
        <p>Only small repairs are covered by the scheme and they&nbsp;must cost less than £250.</p>
        <p>They could include:</p>

        <ul type="disc">
            <li>unsafe plugs or electrical wiring</li>
            <li>blocked flues to fires or boilers</li>
            <li>blocked sinks or toilets</li>
            <li>leaking roofs, pipes, tanks or cisterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contact your landlord for details of their scheme and a full list of the repairs that can be included.</p>
        <p>Your landlord could look at the repair to check it qualifies.</p>

    <h3>Repairs not covered</h3>
        <p>A repair doesn't qualify if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>it costs more than £250</li>
            <li>you caused the problem</li>
            <li>your council has less than 100 properties to let out</li>
            <li>you fail to provide access for inspection or for the repair to be carried out</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>When you report a repair</h2>
        <p>Always report a repair to your landlord as soon as you can. Most councils have an online system for reporting repairs.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout">Use the
            <a href="{{ find_council_url }}" title="Link to Gov.uk local council finder: request a repair to a council property"
               target="_blank">Gov.uk council finder</a> to request a repair to a council property.</p>
        <p>After you report a repair, your landlord should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>say if the repair is covered under the scheme</li>
            <li>explain your rights under the right to repair scheme</li>
            <li>give you the contact details of the contractor who'll be doing the&nbsp;repair</li>
            <li>let you know a time and date to be home to let the contractor in</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tell your landlord if you know you're not going to be home when the contractor arrives. Try to make alternative arrangements.</p>

    <h2>How long repairs should take</h2>
        <p>Repairs must be done within 1, 3 or 7 working days, depending on how urgent the problem is.</p>
        <p>The most urgent repairs could include total loss of water supply or unsafe electrical wiring.
            Less urgent repairs could include an extractor fan not working or a partial loss of water supply.</p>
        <p>Your landlord will tell you how long your repair will take to fix.</p>
        <p>If the contractor doesn't turn up to do the work by the last day of the time limit, let the council know.
            They should&nbsp;make arrangements for another&nbsp;contractor to do the work.</p>
        <p>A new time limit starts the first working day after you tell the council to arrange a replacement contractor.</p>

    <h2>Claim compensation</h2>
        <p>You can claim compensation if the second contractor doesn't do the repair within the new time limit.</p>
        <p>You are entitled to £10 compensation with a further £2 a day for every extra day the repair isn't fixed, up to a maximum of £50.</p>
        <p>If you have rent arrears, the amount is deducted from your arrears.</p>
        <p class="inline-highlight">Contact your landlord to ask about how to apply for compensation.
            You usually have to make a claim in writing.</p>
        <p>You won't get compensation if you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>didn't report the repair</li>
        <li>are out at the agreed time</li>
        <li>don't allow the contractor access to your home</li>
    </ul>
        <p>You probably can't claim compensation if the repair work is cancelled because of unforeseen circumstances,
            such as extreme weather.</p>
