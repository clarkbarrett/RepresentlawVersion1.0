                <small>Find out when you need your landlord's permission to
                    make improvements to your private, council or housing association home.</small>
            </h1>
        </div>

        <h2>What counts as an improvement?</h2>
        <p>Your landlord has a duty to carry out most repairs in your home but doesn't usually have to
            carry out improvements.</p>
        <p>Examples of an improvement include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>insulating your loft</li>
            <li>installing double glazing to replace single glazed windows</li>
            <li>replacing kitchen units with new ones</li>
            <li>redecorating</li>
            <li>putting up a garden shed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your landlord has a
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-landlord_and_tenant_responsibilities_for_repairs' %}">
                duty to carry out most repairs in your home</a> but doesn't usually have to carry out improvements.</p>

        <h2>Council or housing association tenant's home improvements</h2>
        <p>If you rent your home from the council or a housing association, you always need permission
            for major improvements such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>dividing a room to create an extra bedroom</li>
            <li>installing a new kitchen of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are usually responsible for decorating your home and don't need your landlord's permission.</p>
        <p>You might need permission for small improvements such as getting a garden shed.&nbsp;Check what your
            tenancy agreement says.</p>
        <p>Council tenants usually have to pay for their own improvements. You might be able to get compensation
            for doing certain improvements, but only when your tenancy ends.</p>

    <h2>Private tenant's home improvements</h2>
        <p>You usually need your landlord's permission to make any improvements to a private rented home.
            Get their agreement in writing.</p>
        <p>Check what your
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-types-of-renting-agreement' %}"
               title="see also: types of private renting agreement">tenancy agreement</a>
            says about making&nbsp;home improvements.</p>
        <p>Your landlord might agree to improvements you want to make if you agree to put things back the way
            they were when you leave.</p>
        <p>It's usually your responsibility to pay for any improvements you make.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a long-term tenancy agreement you might not benefit much from any improvements you make.
            It can be worthwhile if you have a more secure type of private tenancy such as an

    <h2>Improvements if you have a disability</h2>
        <p>Your landlord should make reasonable adjustments to make sure you're not put at a serious
            disadvantage&nbsp;because of&nbsp;a disability. What's reasonable depends on each individual
            situation.&nbsp;Landlords are not allowed to treat disabled tenants less favourably than others.</p>
        <p>You have to ask your landlord to make reasonable changes for you. For example, you could ask to add a
            ramp over a small front doorstep.</p>

        <p>If you want to make some improvements to your rented home because of a disability, you'll usually
            have to pay for them.&nbsp;You must also ask for your landlord's permission first before you make
            improvements but your landlord can't unreasonably refuse.</p>


    <h2>What to do if your home is unsafe</h2>
        <p>An improvement may sometimes be needed to fix a repair problem or because there is a risk to your
