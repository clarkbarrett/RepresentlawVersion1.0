                <small>If your landlord won't do repairs, there's a procedure you must follow
                        if you want to arrange to have the work done and bill your landlord.</small>

    <h2>Can you do repairs and deduct money from rent?</h2>
        <p>It is possible to do repairs without your landlord's agreement and take the cost out of your rent.&nbsp;
            You're responsible for the quality of the work that's carried out. If repairs are done badly
            you'll have to pay to put things right.</p>
        <p>You must follow the steps set out in this article.&nbsp;You should only use this procedure for minor repairs.</p>
        <p>You can use this procedure if you are a:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>private tenant</li>
            <li>council tenant (but not if you claim housing benefit)</li>
            <li>housing association tenant</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you claim housing benefit, get advice before using this procedure.</p>

    <h2>No right to withhold rent</h2>
        <p>You do not have the right to stop paying rent because your landlord won't do repairs.</p>
        <p>Your landlord can take steps to evict you for rent arrears if you don't pay the rent.
            In most cases a landlord has to go to court to get an order to evict you. The court could decide you
            should be evicted if you have rent arrears.</p>


    <h2>1. Write to inform your landlord about repairs</h2>
        <p>You must let your landlord know that repairs are needed.</p>
        <p>If you haven't already told your landlord about repairs, you can use Shelter's template letter
            to write to your landlord to ask for repairs.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout download">

        <p>Keep copies of all correspondence to and from your landlord and keep accurate records of what you've paid.</p>

    <h2>2. Write saying you plan to arrange repairs</h2>
        <p>Write to your landlord again if you don't get a reply or if the work doesn't start.</p>
        <p>Explain that unless the repairs are done within a certain time (for example two weeks),
            you'll arrange the work yourself and take the costs out of your rent.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout download">Use Shelter's template letter to

    <h2>3. Get quotes for repair work</h2>
        <p>After the time you gave the landlord to start the repairs runs out, get three estimates or quotes for
            the repair work from reliable contractors</p>

    <h2>4. Send quotes to your landlord</h2>
        <p>Send the quotes to your landlord with a letter explaining that unless they get the repairs done
            within a certain time (for example two weeks), you'll go ahead with the cheapest quote.</p>

                cheapest quote if they don't do repairs</a>.</p>
        <p>This is the second of four letters you must write.</p>

     <h2>5. Arrange for repair work to be done</h2>
        <p>Once the time you gave your landlord has passed, if your landlord hasn't responded, arrange for the
            work to be done by the contractor that gave the cheapest quote.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout urgent">Don't proceed if you have doubts about the contractor.
            You'll have to put things right if the work is done badly.</p>

    <h2>6. Send receipts to your landlord</h2>

        <p>Pay for the work yourself and send a copy of the receipt to your landlord with a letter asking
            them to refund the money.</p>
