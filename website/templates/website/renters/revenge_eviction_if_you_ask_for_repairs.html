    <h2>Risk of revenge eviction</h2>
        <p>Revenge eviction is when a landlord tries to evict you after you ask for repairs or
            complain about conditions in your home.</p>
        <p>This is also called retaliatory eviction.</p>
        <p>This might affect you if you're a private tenant with an
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-eviction-of-assured-shorthold-tenants' %}" title="See also: eviction of assured shorthold tenants">
                assured shorthold tenancy
            </a>. That's because it's easy to evict tenants with this type of contract.</p>
        <p>A change in the law could make it harder for some landlords to do this. The change affects
            assured shorthold tenancies that started or were renewed on or after 1 October 2015.</p>
        <p>If you're a private tenant with an

            </a>, you already have more protection from revenge eviction. You can't be evicted unless

        <p>If your tenancy started before 1 October 2015, there's no special protection that prevents

        <p class="advice-highlight normal-advice">Rules that could protect you from retaliatory eviction

    <h2>Assured shorthold tenancies starting from 1 Oct 2015</h2>
        <p>New rules could help if you complain about repairs or conditions in your home and your
            landlord responds by giving you a section 21 notice.</p>
        <p class="advice-highlight normal-advice">The rules apply if your new assured shorthold tenancy started
            on or after 1 October 2015 or you signed a renewal contract on or after that date.</p>

    <h3>Section 21 served after you complain to your landlord</h3>
        <p>The new rules mean a court can refuse to order your eviction if all these apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you complained to your landlord or letting agent&nbsp;in writing (by letter or email)</li>
            <li>your landlord

                   title="see also: Complain to environmental health about rented housing">
                    complained to the local council
                </a> because your landlord didn't take steps to fix the problem</li>
            <li>the council sent your landlord a notice telling them to make improvements or that the council
                will carry out emergency work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The new rules may also apply if you first complained about the repairs to the council because you
            didn't have a

               title="see also: how to find your landlord">postal or email address for your landlord</a>.</p>
        <p>Once the council serves your landlord with an improvement notice or notice requiring remedial action,
            the section 21 notice becomes invalid.</p>
        <p>If the improvement notice is served before the court hearing, your landlord's case will fail
            and the court won't order you to leave.</p>
        <p class="advice-highlight normal-advice">If the council doesn't serve your landlord with an
            improvement notice before the court hearing, the court can make an order for you to leave.
            The court can't overturn an order to evict you if the council's notice comes later.</p>

    <h3>Section 21 served after the council sends your landlord a notice</h3>
        <p>If the council send your landlord an improvement notice or notice requiring improvement and
            your landlord later gives you a section 21 notice, it won't be valid if it's served within
            6 months of the council's notice.</p>
        <p>A section 21 notice will be valid if it's served
        after 6 months have passed.</p>

    <h2>When the new rules won't help</h2>
        <p>The new rules won't help if you:</p><ul>
        <li>only complained verbally or your landlord serves a section 21 notice before you complained
            to them in writing</li>
        <li>complain to the council but it takes no action or serves your landlord with a 'hazard notice'</li>
    </ul>
        <p>The new rules also won't help if your landlord can prove to the court that:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>you caused the problem you're complaining about</li>
            <li>they've genuinely put the property up for sale &ndash; sales to friends, family or business
                partners might not count</li>
            <li>the property has been repossessed by the landlord's lender and the property will be sold with
                vacant possession (this will not apply if your tenancy started before your landlord took
                out the mortgage)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A section 21 notice is valid if your landlord gives it to you after the council serves
            your landlord an improvement notice but suspends enforcement action. The council may
            decide not to enforce the notice if there aren't any young children or anyone over the
            age of 60 in your home.</p>
        <p>The new rules don't help you if your landlord uses the section 8 court procedure for
