    <h2>What is a letting agent redress scheme?</h2>
        <p>Letting agents must join a government approved letting agent redress scheme.</p>
        <p>The three letting agent redress schemes are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Property Ombudsman (TPO)</li>
            <li>The Property Redress Scheme</li>
            <li>Ombudsman Services Property</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Letting agent redress schemes provide a free, independent service for resolving disputes between
            letting agents and their customers.&nbsp;Landlords and tenants can complain to the schemes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Letting agents must cooperate with any investigation.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The decision made by a redress scheme is binding on all parties.</p>
        <p>The letting agency has to comply with any orders to pay you compensation, to pay a fine or to put
            something right. Tell the scheme if the letting agent doesn't comply.</p>

    <h2>Check which scheme a letting agent belongs to</h2>
        <p>Ask your letting agent&nbsp;which scheme they belong to or&nbsp;check their website. Some letting
            agents display details on stickers in their windows.</p>
        <p>You can search each scheme's membership list to find out which one a letting agent has joined.</p>
        <p>It's an offence for a letting agent not to join a redress scheme.&nbsp;Your&nbsp;
            <a title="Link to Gov.uk - find your local council "
               href="{{ find_council_url }}" target="_blank">local council</a> can investigate and prosecute letting agents
            who haven't joined to a scheme.</p>
        <p>The council can issue a fixed penalty fine of up to Â£5000 to a letting agency branch that is
            not a member of a scheme. Letting agents with multiple branches could face multiple fines.</p>

    <h2>What you can complain about</h2>
        <p>Issues you can complain about to a letting agent redress scheme include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>lack of transparency about fees</li>
            <li>inaccurate property descriptions</li>
            <li>disputes about holding deposits taken to reserve a property</li>
            <li>not passing rent onto the landlord</li>
            <li>slow or poor service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also complain if a letting agent breaches the redress scheme's code of conduct or doesn't
            have&nbsp;an in-house complaints procedure.</p>

        <p class="inline-callout highlight">The schemes won't cover complaints about the amount of fees charged
            or if they are reasonable, tenancy deposits or issues which are the landlord's responsibility.</p>

    <h2>When to complain</h2>
        <p>You can only complain to a redress scheme after you have given the letting agency the chance
            to deal with your complaint first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You can complain to the letting agent's redress scheme&nbsp;after you receive their final response
            to your complaint or after 8 weeks if the letting agent doesn't resolve the issue within this time.</p>
        <p>You must complain within the time limit set by the redress scheme.&nbsp;You may prefer to complain after
            you have left.</p>

    <h2>Other ways to resolve the dispute&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>Letting agent redress schemes aren't the only way to resolve disputes with letting agencies.</p>
        <p>Your other options could include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>complaining to your local council</li>
            <li>complaining to a letting agent's professional association, if it is a member</li>
            <li>taking the letting agent to court to claim compensation (letting agent redress&nbsp;schemes
                can't help if you have already started court action about a dispute)</li>
        </ul>
