    <h2>Leaving your home temporarily because of disrepair</h2>
        <p>Your landlord may ask you to move out temporarily during major repair work to your home.</p>
        <p>Before moving out, ask your landlord to confirm in writing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how long the works will last</li>
            <li>your right to return to the property after the work is completed</li>
            <li>details of any alternative accommodation the landlord can provide for you</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your landlord can apply to the courts for an order for you to leave if you refuse to
            leave while repairs are being done.</p>
        <p>If you have limited tenancy rights, your landlord might give you notice to end your tenancy instead.</p>

    <h2>Leaving your home permanently because of disrepair</h2>

            if the disrepair in your home is bad and your landlord refuses to make repairs.</p>
        <p>You must end your tenancy properly if you want to leave. If you don't, you could be
