                <small>You can contact the ombudsman if you complained to your council or housing association about

    <h2>How the housing ombudsman can help</h2>
        <p>The Housing Ombudsman Service is an independent watchdog.&nbsp;They deal with complaints from council
            tenants and housing association tenants. The service is free.</p>
        <p>The service investigates complaints about councils or housing associations doing things the wrong
            way or&nbsp;not doing something they should have done.&nbsp;The ombudsman does not investigate every
            complaint made to them.</p>
        <p>The ombudsman service can look at how your landlord dealt with your request for repairs. The service
            decides if your landlord acted properly and followed the correct procedures.&nbsp;Their decisions
            are not legally binding but most landlords usually follow them.</p>
        <p>If they agree with your complaint, they can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>recommend that your landlord takes steps to put things right</li>
            <li>suggest that the landlord pays you compensation</li>
        </ul>

                </div>

    <h2>How to complain</h2>
        <p>You must use your landlord's formal complaints procedure first. You can complain to the ombudsman
            if you are not satisfied with the outcome.</p>
        <p>Put your complaint in writing and include any evidence that supports it.</p>
        <p>Evidence can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>photographs showing the repairs which need doing</li>
            <li>photographs of damaged belongings</li>
            <li>copies of any letters you sent to your landlord</li>
            <li>copies of any doctor's notes or hospital reports which show that your health has been
                affected by the problem</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Include receipts for any money you spent because of the repair problem (for example if you
            had to replace damaged belongings).</p>
