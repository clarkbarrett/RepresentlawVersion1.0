            <h2>If you leave owing your landlord money</h2>
            <p>If you leave owing your landlord money, they can take legal action against you.</p>
            <p>Your landlord could apply to the court for a money judgment (known as a county court judgment or CCJ).
                This sets out how much you owe and how you should pay it back.</p>
            <p>You have 14 days to respond to the claim. If you lose, you may have to pay court costs.</p>
            <p>Having a CCJ against you affects your ability to take out loans and get credit.
                It could also make it difficult for you to rent privately in the future .</p>

            <h2>If you leave a fixed term contract early</h2>
            <p>A fixed contract means a fixed commitment.
            You are usually asked to sign a contract that commits you for a minimum of six months or a year.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you leave before the tenancy ends you still have to pay the rent.</p>
            <p>Some contracts include a 'break clause' which gives you the option of giving notice to leave before
                the end of the fixed term. If you don't have a break clause, you'll need your landlord's agreement
                to end the tenancy early.</p>
            <p>Your landlord can only take court action to evict you within the fixed
            term if you have broken the terms of the tenancy agreement, for example, by having rent arrears.</p>

            <h2>If your housemate leaves</h2>
            <p>When you sign a joint tenancy agreement with housemates you're
            all responsible for paying all of the rent.</p>
            <p>If one of you can't pay, the rest of you have to find the extra money or risk being evicted.</p>

                joint tenancy</a>
                early, yours and their responsibilities don't end.
                The landlord has a legal right to pursue any one or all of the joint tenants for the
                whole rent payment, including the person who has left. If the rent isn't paid,
                everyone left in the property could be evicted.</p>
            <p>It's best to talk about the situation if anyone wants to leave. If some of you don't
                want to move out, you can try to negotiate a new agreement with the landlord. Or you
                may be able to find someone to take on the share of the person who wants to leave,
                although the landlord would have to agree to this.</p>
            <p>A fixed-term tenancy can only be ended early if all the joint tenants agree. And your
                landlord must also agree the tenancy can end early (unless there is a 'break'
                clause in your tenancy agreement that allows it).</p>

            <h2>If you split up</h2>
            <p>If you both sign a joint tenancy, you each have the right to live in the home,
                even if you break up. You can&rsquo;t stop your partner living in the home,
                unless you get a court order.</p>

            <p>A joint tenancy means you are both responsible for paying the rent. If one of you leaves,
                the landlord can ask either one or both of you for the money. Whoever is left behind risks
                being evicted if the rent isn't paid.</p>

            <h2>When your guarantor must pay&nbsp;</h2>
            <p>You may need a guarantor if you are a student or young person renting for the first time
                or you can't prove that you can pay the rent.&nbsp;Your guarantor usually needs to be a
                UK resident and own a property.</p>
            <p>Your guarantor has to pay the rent if you don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;The guarantor agreement
                is legally binding.</p>
            <p>Your guarantor should check carefully what they are agreeing to cover.
                In shared houses, the agreement may cover a joint tenants rent arrears as well as your own.</p>
