    <h2>When tenancy deposit protection doesn't apply</h2>
        <p>If you're not an assured shorthold tenant your landlord doesn't have to protect your deposit
            in a government-backed tenancy deposit scheme.</p>
        <p>You probably won't be an assured shorthold tenant if you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>are a lodger or live in the same house as your landlord</li>
            <li>live in a student halls of residence</li>
            <li>have an assured tenancy or regulated tenancy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means that if your landlord doesn't return your deposit, the only way to get your money back is
            to take your landlord to court.</p>

    <h2>Return of your deposit</h2>
        <p>A tenancy deposit is your money. It should be returned to you at the end of your tenancy.</p>
        <p>Your landlord can make reasonable&nbsp;

                deductions from your deposit</a> if for example you've not paid all the rent due or caused damage.</p>

    <h2>Consider court action</h2>
        <p>If you can't persuade your landlord to return your deposit,&nbsp;you can ask a county court to settle the dispute.</p>
        <p>The court will look at all the evidence and decide if your landlord should return all or part of your deposit.</p>
        <p>Your case should be dealt with as a small claim if you are claiming less than Â£10,000 from your landlord. The
            court decides how it will deal with your case.</p>
        <p>You can't get&nbsp;legal aid to help with this type of court action.</p>
        <p>You can ask a housing adviser for help.</p>

    <h2>Send a letter before action</h2>
        <p>Going to court should be your last resort. Before you start a court claim, you must send your landlord a letter before action.</p>
    <p>The letter should include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>dates of any letters and emails you sent to your landlord about the deposit</li>
        <li>details of any deductions and why you disagree with them</li>
        <li>a deadline, such as 14 days, for your landlord to respond</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pay court fees to start a deposit claim</h3>
        <p>You have to pay a fee to start your claim. The amount varies depending on how much you're claiming back
            from your landlord.</p>
    <p>If you have a low income or claim benefits, you can apply for reduced fees or an exemption (called 'remission').</p>

            HM Courts and Tribunals about court fees.</a></p>
    <p>If you win your case, you can claim your court fees back from your landlord. If you don't win, you'll lose
        your court fee.</p>
    <p>You can't make your claim online if you are asking for a fee exemption.</p>

    <h3>Provide the court with important documents</h3>
        <p>Unless you make your claim online, attach copies of all the relevant documents to your claim form. These can include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a copy of your tenancy or licence agreement</li>
            <li>letters to and from your landlord</li>

            <li>statements from witnesses</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Claim for interest and court fees</h3>
        <p>You can also ask the court to make your landlord pay interest on the amount of deposit they owe you
            and the court fees you paid to start your claim.</p>
        <p>Interest can be claimed from the date your deposit should have been returned. You must state on your
            claim form if you want to claim interest.</p>

    <h2>Court contact with your landlord</h2>
        <p>The court sends a copy of your claim with forms for your landlord to fill in and return to the court.</p>
        <p>Your landlord could:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>agree with your claim and pay in full</li>
            <li>pay part of your claim</li>
            <li>disagree with your claim and challenge it in court</li>
            <li>do nothing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your landlord is usually given 14 days to respond.</p>

    <h3>If your landlord doesn't respond to the court</h3>
        <p>You can apply to the court to order your landlord to pay the money you've claimed, along with interest and your court fee.</p>

    <h3>If your landlord makes an offer</h3>
        <p>Your landlord may make you an offer at this stage. If you accept an offer, contact the court to say you're
            withdrawing your claim. You should also confirm that you've told your landlord you're doing this</p>
    <p>If you turn down a reasonable offer from your landlord the judge may decide that you have to pay some of your
        landlord's court expenses.</p><p>Get advice if you're not sure about accepting an offer.</p>

    <h2>Attend the court hearing</h2>
        <p>if your landlord disputes your claim, the court will set a date for a court hearing.&nbsp;The court will write to
            tell you the date.</p>
    <p>The court also sets a deadline for you and your landlord to provided documents to the court. You usually have
        to provide all the evidence at least 14 days before the hearing.</p>
    <p>You'll need to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>send in important documents if you haven't already done so</li>
        <li>prepare and sign a short statement setting out the history of what has happened</li>
        <li>attach all the evidence you want the judge to consider</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any witnesses (such as a friend who can confirm the state of the property when you moved in)
        must also sign a written statement.</p>
    <p>The court hearing should be informal and you can represent yourself. The judge will ask questions
        based on the evidence provided.</p>
    <p>Your landlord may be represented by a solicitor.</p>

    <h2>Court decisions about disputed deposits</h2>
        <p>If you win a court hearing about the return of your deposit, the court orders your landlord to
            pay your claim plus your court fee and any interest claimed.</p>
        <p>The court can provide you with information about what you can do if your landlord doesn't pay you.</p>

               target="_blank">Download court&nbsp;leaflet EX321</a>.</p>
        <p>If you lose the case there's nothing more you can do to get your deposit back unless you appeal.
            This could be because you think the court hasn't considered the evidence properly.</p>
