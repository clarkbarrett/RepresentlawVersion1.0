                <h1>What is a tenancy deposit?<br>
                    <small>Most private landlords ask new tenants to pay a tenancy deposit to cover damage or
                        unpaid rent.</small>
                </h1>
            </div>
    <h2>Why you pay a tenancy deposit</h2>
        <p>You pay a tenancy deposit to give your landlord protection in case you leave without paying the
            rent or cause damage to the property or its contents.</p>
        <p>Your landlord should confirm in writing what the deposit covers. This may be set out in your
            tenancy agreement or your landlord may give you a separate document that's signed by both you
            and your landlord.</p>

    <h2>What a tenancy deposit costs</h2>
        <p>Landlords usually ask for a tenancy deposit that's equivalent to one or two months' rent.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">You may be asked to pay a bigger deposit if the landlord
            is concerned about your credit rating or if you can't provide someone to act as a guarantor.</p>
        <p>There's no legal limit on the amount that landlords can ask for.</p>

    <h2>Who you pay the deposit to</h2>
        <p>Tenancy deposits are often paid direct to landlords.</p>
        <p>You may be asked to pay the tenancy deposit to a
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-using_a_letting_agent_to_find_and_rent_a_home' %}"
               title="See also: Using letting agents to rent a home">letting agent if you rent a home through them</a>.</p>

    <h2>How your deposit is protected</h2>
        <p>If you are a private tenant with an assured shorthold tenancy, your deposit must be protected&nbsp;with
            a government-backed tenancy deposit scheme.</p>
        <p>Your landlord must follow

    <h2>Holding deposits</h2>
        <p>You might be asked for a holding deposit when you agree to rent a property.</p>
        <p>By paying a holding deposit, you commit to taking up the tenancy so that it isn't let
            to someone else.&nbsp;The landlord or letting agent holds the property for you until you
            sign the contract.</p>
        <p>A holding deposit should be returned to you when you sign the contract. It can also
            be used as payment towards rent in advance or your tenancy deposit.</p>
        <p>Holding deposits do not have to be protected in a government-backed scheme.</p>
        <p>If the holding deposit is used as part of your deposit,&nbsp;
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-tenancy_deposit_protection_rules' %}"
               title="see also: tenancy deposit protection scheme rules">
                tenancy deposit protection rules
            </a> apply from that point.</p>
        <p>Check what the holding deposit covers, how it will be used and the conditions for a refund.</p>
        <p>Don't pay a holding deposit unless you are certain you want that particular property. If you decide
            not to move in, it could be difficult to get it back.</p>

    <h2>Smart deposits</h2>
        <p>A landlord or letting agent may ask you&nbsp;to pay a non-refundable smart deposit rather
            than a tenancy deposit.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Despite the name, this is not a deposit. It's an insurance policy.</p>
        <p>You pay either a lump sum or a monthly amount on top of your rent.&nbsp;The cost is less than you
            would pay for a tenancy deposit, but&nbsp;you don't get any of it back when you leave.</p>
        <p>After you leave, if you owe the landlord rent or have damaged the property, the insurance
            company makes a pay out to the landlord.&nbsp;The insurance company can ask you to repay
            any money it pays to your landlord.</p>
        <p>
            Smart deposits do not have to be protected in a government-backed scheme.</p>
