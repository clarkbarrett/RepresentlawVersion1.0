    <h2>How the court can help</h2>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for doing most repairs. You can take court action if you've asked your landlord
            to do repairs but they don't.</p>
        <p>You can ask the court to order your landlord to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>carry out the repairs needed</li>
            <li>pay you compensation</li>
            <li>both do the repairs and pay compensation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">You can make a claim for compensation&nbsp;even after your tenancy has ended.</p>

    <h2>Legal aid for repairs cases</h2>
        <p>Legal aid can help people on a low income with certain types of legal action.</p>
        <p>You can only get legal aid for a repairs case if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>there is a serious risk of harm to you or others in your household, or</li>
            <li>your landlord has started a possession claim against you because of

                    rent arrears</a> and part of your defence is that repairs weren't done</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can't get legal aid if you only want to claim compensation from your landlord.</p>

    <h3>If you don't qualify for legal aid</h3>
        <p>You can take legal action by yourself but some tenants decide to get legal help.</p>
        <p>Ask a solicitor about a conditional fee arrangement if you can't get legal aid. This can mean you don't pay
            a fee if you lose your case.</p>

    <h2>What legal action costs</h2>
        <h3>Court fees</h3>
        <p>You usually have to pay court fees to take legal action. Fees can be reduced or waived if you claim
            benefits or have a low income.</p>

    <h3>Expert's reports</h3>
        <p>You might need to pay for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an expert's report to tell the court about the condition of your home</li>
            <li>a medical report if your health has been affected</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A solicitor can arrange these for you.&nbsp;If you win your case, you can claim back these
            costs from your landord.</p>

    <h2>How to prepare for your case</h2>
        <p>Going to court should be your last resort.</p>
        <h3>Report repairs</h3>
        <p>A court case won't suceed if you didn't report the repairs to your landlord.</p>
        <p>
            <a title="see also: reporting repairs to a private landlord"

            Report repairs problems to the council or to a housing association</a>.</p>

    <h3>Gather evidence</h3>
        <p>Your evidence could include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>copies of letters that show you reported the problem to your landlord</li>
            <li>photographs showing examples of the disrepair or damaged property</li>
            <li>receipts proving you had to replace things damaged or destroyed by the problem</li>
            <li>medical reports explaining how your health has been affected</li>
            <li>report from your council's environmental health department</li>
        </ul>

   <h3>Send a letter before action</h3>
        <p>You must send a 'letter before action' to your landlord, even if you have already
            told them you're going to start legal action.</p>
        <p>The letter must:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>explain what the repairs problem is</li>
            <li>set out details of when you told the landlord about the problem</li>
            <li>give the landlord 20 working days to put the problem right &ndash; unless the repair is urgent</li>
            <li>state that if the landlord doesn't put the problem right within that time, you intend to take them to court</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After 20 working days have passed, you can start your claim in the court.</p>

    <h2>How to start your court claim</h2>
        <p>You can start a claim after your tenancy has ended.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start your claim by filling in claim form N1.</li>
            <li>Send 2 copies of your claim form to the court where you want to start court action.</li
            <li>Keep a copy for yourself.</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>When the small claims court is used</h3>
        <p>The court decides how to deal with your case.&nbsp;Many repairs cases are dealt with under
            the 'small claims' track in the county court.</p>
        <p>It should be dealt with as a small claim if you want to ask the court to order your landlord to either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>do repairs that cost under £1000 and pay you compensation of no more than £1000</li>
            <li>only pay you compensation of up to £10,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An advantage with smalls claims is that if you lose, you don't have to pay your landlord's costs.
            &nbsp;The court procedure is usually simpler and quicker. It's easier to represent yourself
            in court too.</p>

    <h3>Attend the court hearing</h3>
        <p>Hearings usually take place in a room called chambers. This could be the judge's private room or a
            courtroom. The public aren't allowed to sit in.</p>
        <p>You can be represented at the hearing by a lawyer or adviser or you can represent yourself</p>
        <p>Before making its decision, the court looks at all the evidence you and your landlord have provided.</p>

    <h2>What the court can decide</h2>
        <p>The court can order your landlord to carry out the work immediately in emergency situations,
            for example if it's dangerous for you to live in the property.</p>

        <p>The court can order your landlord to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>carry out the specified work by a certain date</li>
            <li>pay you amount in compensation and pay your costs</li>
        </ul><p>The court could also make a declaration that you can do the repairs yourself and deduct what
        you pay out from future rent.</p>
        <p>If your evidence isn't strong enough, the court could dismiss your claim.</p>

   <h3>If a landlord ignores the court</h3>
        <p>If a landlord doesn't carry out works ordered by the court, they'll be in contempt of
            court and can be fined or even sent to prison.</p>
        <p>You might have to take further court action if your landlord
            doesn't pay you the compensation ordered by the court.</p>
