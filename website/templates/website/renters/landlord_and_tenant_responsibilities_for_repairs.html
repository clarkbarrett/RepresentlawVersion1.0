    <h2>Landlord's repair responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for most repairs in your home. This applies to private, council and housing
            association landlords.</p>
        <p>Your landlord's responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the structure and exterior of the building, including the walls, stairs and bannisters, roof,
                external doors and windows</li>
            <li>sinks, baths, toilets and other sanitary fittings, including pipes and drains</li>
            <li>heating and hot water</li>
            <li>chimneys and ventilation</li>
            <li>electrical wiring</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for repairing the common parts of a building, such as entrance halls,
            communal stairways and shared kitchens.</p>
        <p>Your landlord also must put right any damage to internal decorations caused by repair problems
            or while repairs were carried out.</p>
        <p>Check your tenancy agreement to see if your landlord is responsible for repairing or replacing
            faulty items or appliances they provided, such as a fridge, washing machine or gas oven.</p>

    <h2>Check what your tenancy agreement says</h2>
        <p>Most tenants have a written tenancy agreement. This usually includes details about who is
            responsible for repairs. Your landlord must do the repairs the law says they are responsible for,
            even if your agreement says something different.</p>
        <p>Your tenancy agreement may say when or how often certain types of repairs will be done.
            It may say that you have some responsibilities, for example keeping the garden tidy or
            sharing the cleaning of communal stairways and halls.</p>



    <h2>Landlord's responsibility for health and safety</h2>
        <p>Your landlord should make sure that your home is free from any hazards that could affect the health
            and safety of anyone in your household.</p>
