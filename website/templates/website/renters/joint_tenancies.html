    <h2>Tenancy agreements</h2>
        <p>You have a joint tenancy if you and the other tenants all signed a single tenancy agreement with a
            landlord when you moved in.</p>
        <p>If each of you signed a separate agreement with the landlord, you have separate tenancies.</p>

     <h2>Right to rent</h2>
        <p>You can only become a private tenant if you have the right to rent. Each joint tenant must have
            the right to rent.</p>
        <p>A private landlord or letting agent must carry out a right to rent
            check before you sign up to a private tenancy.</p>

     <h2>Paying the rent when you're a joint tenant</h2>
        <p>Joint tenants are each jointly and individually responsible for paying the rent.</p>
        <p>If one tenant moves out without giving notice or doesn't pay their share of the rent, the other
            joint tenants are responsible for paying it for them.</p>
        <p>If none of you pay your rent, your landlord can ask any one of you to pay the outstanding rent.</p>

     <h2>Deductions from a tenancy deposit</h2>
        <p>The landlord normally takes a single deposit for the whole of the tenancy. Even if you and the other
            joint tenants paid separate or different shares to the landlord or agent.</p>
        <p>If one joint tenant fails to pay their share of the rent or if they cause damage to the property,
            the landlord is entitled to deduct the shortfall or the costs of the damage from the whole deposit.</p>

        <p>You and the other joint tenants decide how to divide up the remaining deposit when it is returned.</p>

     <h2>Tenancy deposits when a joint tenant moves out</h2>
        <p>If you are replacing another tenant who is moving out, they may ask you to pay the deposit to them instead.
            This could cause problems. If the tenant who is moving out has caused any damage to the property or left
            any unpaid bills, the landlord can deduct these costs from the deposit when you move out.</p>
        <p>Get advice if you are in this situation. It might be better to ask the landlord to give a new tenancy
            agreement to you and the other tenants who are staying on.</p><p>

    <h2>How you can end a fixed-term joint tenancy</h2>
        <p>If you have a fixed-term tenancy (for example for
        12 months) you can only the tenancy before the fixed term ends if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you, the other tenants and your landlord all agree that the tenancy can end early (this is called
                a 'surrender')</li>
            <li>there is a 'break clause' in your tenancy agreement, which allows you to give notice and end
                your tenancy early</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You need the agreement of the other joint tenants to end your tenancy early.</p>

            <a href="{% url 'renters-how_tenants_can_end_a_fixed_term_tenancy' %}"

     <h2>How to end a joint tenancy that isn't a fixed-term</h2>
        <p>If you don't have a fixed-term tenancy or it has ended and not been renewed, you or any other joint
            tenant can end the tenancy by giving a valid notice to quit to the landlord.</p>
        <p>You can do this with or without the agreement of the other joint tenants. The tenancy ends
            for all the joint tenants.</p>
        <p>When the notice to quit expires none of you has the right to continue living there.</p>

     <h2>Leaving a joint tenancy</h2>
        <p>If you want to leave a joint tenancy and the others want to stay it is usually best to discuss it with
            the other joint tenants before you take any action.</p>
        <p>If they don't want to move out, they can try to negotiate a new agreement with the landlord.</p>
        <p>The remaining tenants may be able to find another person to become a joint tenant with
            them. They must get the landlord's agreement for this.</p>
        <p>Or the remaining tenants could all agree to stay on and pay the rent between them.</p>
        <p>However if the joint tenancy has not been ended the landlord could still ask you to pay
            any arrears if the rent is not fully paid, even if you are no longer living there.</p>

     <h2>Eviction of joint tenants</h2>
        <p>Your landlord cannot evict one joint tenant without evicting all the others.</p>
        <p>Your landlord may be able to end the tenancy and offer a new one to the remaining tenants.</p>
        <p>Talk to your landlord as soon as possible if you are in this situation and you want to stay.</p>

     <h2>Relationship breakdown</h2>
        <p>Your landlord could grant you a new tenancy in your name only if the joint tenancy with your ex-partner
            has been properly ended.</p>
        <p>You may also have other rights. For example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>it may be possible for court to transfer the tenancy into your name &ndash; even
                if the other joint tenant won't agree to it</li>
            <li>it may be possible to stop the other joint tenant from ending the tenancy by applying
                for an occupation order or an injunction</li>
            <li>if you have experienced domestic violence, it may be possible to
                keep the perpetrator out of your home or to take legal action such
                as an&nbsp;injunction</li>

     <h2>Problems with other joint tenants</h2>
        <p>If you have a problem with another joint tenant you probably have to sort this out yourself.</p>
        <p>Landlords are usually reluctant to get involved, although council or housing associations are
            more likely to get involved than private landlords.</p>
