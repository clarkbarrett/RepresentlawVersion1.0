    <h2>Report a fire</h2>
        <p>Call the Fire Brigade on 999 to report a fire</p>
        <p>You can also call if you smell burning, but don't know where it's coming from.</p>

    <h2>Landlords responsibility for fire safety</h2>
        <p>Landlords are responsible for the safety of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the electrical wiring and any electrical appliances they provide</li>
            <li>the gas supply and any gas appliances they provide&nbsp;&ndash; they have a legal duty to have
                these checked each year by a gas safe engineer</li>
            <li>any furniture they provide&nbsp;&ndash; upholstered furniture should usually be fire resistant</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="inline-callout urgent">Landlords can be fined and sent to prison if they don't follow fire safety regulations.</p>

    <h2>Smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors</h2>
        <p>By 1st October 2015, all private landlords had to make sure that working smoke alarms were
            fitted on each floor of their rented properties.</p>
        <p>After that they must make sure that the smoke alarms provided are in working order at the start of any new tenancy.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for checking the alarm works after you move in. If an alarm stops working, check if
            it needs new batteries or contact the landlord to arrange a replacement alarm.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout urgent">You should allow your landlord access to your home to fit or repair smoke alarms.</p>
        <p>Most council and housing association landlords also fit smoke alarms in their properties.</p>
        <p>If you have a coal or wood fire in your rented home, your landlord must fit a carbon monoxide detector.</p>

    <h3>Complain to the council about smoke alarms</h3>
        <p>You can complain to your council's environmental health department if your private landlord hasn't
            fitted a smoke alarm in your home or carbon monoxide detector if it's required.</p>
        <p>The council can issue a notice telling your landlord to fit and test the alarms within 28 days.</p>
        <p>If the landlord doesn't do this, the council can fine the landlord up to Â£5000 and arrange to fit the alarms itself.</p>
