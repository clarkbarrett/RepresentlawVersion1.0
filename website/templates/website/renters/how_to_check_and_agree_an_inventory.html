    <h2>What is an inventory?</h2>
        <p>At the start of a tenancy, the landlord or
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-using_a_letting_agent_to_find_and_rent_a_home' %}"
               title="See also: Using a letting agent to find and rent a home">letting agent
            </a> should draw up an inventory for you that records the condition of the property.
            Another one should be done when you move out.</p>
        <p>It should be easy to understand and say who carried it out and when. Your landlord or
            letting agent may charge you for compiling an inventory.</p>
        <p>An inventory can help avoid a dispute over the return of your
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-what_is_a_tenancy_deposit' %}"
               title="See also: What is a tenancy deposit?"><strong>tenancy deposit</strong>
            </a> when you move out. This is because it proves the state of property when you moved in.
            It's in your landlord's interest to provide one.</p>
        <p>Keep a copy of the inventory for your records.</p>

    <h2>Check and sign</h2>
        <p>You'll need to check what's recorded in the inventory before you sign it.</p>
        <p>It should provide an overview of the whole property and a list of its contents,
            with detailed information like the condition of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the walls, ceiling and floor</li>
            <li>the paintwork</li>
            <li>carpets and curtains</li>
            <li>any furniture and appliances</li>
            <li>fittings such as cupboards</li>
            <li>windows and doors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The inventory will say whether smoke alarms and any carbon monoxide detectors are provided and working.</p>
        <p>The inventory may also contain a record of meter readings.</p>
        <p>You can amend the inventory to record anything that's incorrect. You can:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>add details of anything that's missing</li>
            <li>note damage that's not been recorded</li>
            <li>write down if something's not working</li>
            <li>amend incorrect meter readings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take photos of any cracks, marks or scratches that aren&rsquo;t recorded in the inventory.</p>
        <p class="inline-highlight">Only sign and date the inventory when you&rsquo;re happy it&rsquo;s accurate.</p>

    <h2>Keep records of repairs</h2>
        <p>You must <a href="{% url 'website:renters-how_to_report_repairs_to_a_private_landlord' %}"
               title="See also: How to report repairs to a private landlord">report repairs
            </a> to your landlord in writing as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Keep records if you replace something you broke or had something mended (for example because of
            accidental damage).</p>
        <p>Keep copies of correspondence between you and your landlord.</p>
        <p>Keep a record of any damage to your belongings or health that results from repairs not being done.</p>

    <h2>Check your inventory when you move</h2>
        <p>Try to be present when your landlord or agent is taking an inventory when you move out.</p>
        <p>You can make sure any disagreements are recorded and provide proof of damage that was there
            before you moved in.</p>
        <p class="inline-highlight">Sign and date the moving-out inventory if you're happy it's accurate</p>

    <h2>Disputes at the end of your tenancy</h2>
        <p>If you broke or damaged anything in the property while you were living there, your landlord can make
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-tenancy_deposit_deductions_your_landlord_can_make' %}"
               title="See also: Tenancy deposit deductions your landlord can make">
                tenancy deposit deductions
            </a>.</p>
        <p>Your landlord shouldn&rsquo;t make deductions for normal wear and tear, such as worn carpets or faded
            curtains.</p>
        <p>You can dispute unfair deductions from your tenancy deposit. A tenancy deposit protection scheme or
            court will expect your landlord to provide evidence to support any deductions made.</p>
