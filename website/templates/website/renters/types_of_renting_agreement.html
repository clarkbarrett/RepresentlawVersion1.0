                <p>Certain rights and obligations apply regardless of what the agreement says, for example: a

            <h2>Verbal renting agreements</h2>

                    <p>Some rules apply to everyone renting a home. These rules don't have to be written down.</p>
                    <p>Most landlords give their tenants a written agreement.&nbsp;If you don't have a written agreement,
                        you still have legal rights.&nbsp;If the landlord accepts rent from you for living in the property,
                        any verbal agreement you have counts as a legal agreement.</p>
                    <p>Ask your landlord to put your agreement in writing.&nbsp;Having a written agreement
                        helps make sure that both you and your landlord understand your rights and responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Verbal agreements can be more difficult to enforce if there is any dispute.</p>


            <h2>Fixed-term and periodic agreements</h2>
                <p>Some tenancy agreements are granted for a fixed-term, such as six months or one year.</p>
                    <p>When the fixed-term ends&nbsp;your landlord could either:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>give you a new agreement for a further fixed-term</li>
                        <li>allow your tenancy to automatically continue by rolling on from roll from month to month
                            or week to week&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <h2>Difference between a tenancy and a licence</h2>
                    <p>Your renting agreement with your landlord is either a tenancy or a licence.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The main difference between a tenancy and a licence is that a tenancy usually gives
                        you more protection from eviction.</p>
                    <p>You do not have a licence or a tenancy just because the landlord says that's what you have.</p>
                    <p>Your agreement with your landlord can give you extra rights. It cannot take away any rights that
                        the law gives you. These rights depend upon the type of tenancy or licence you have.</p>

            <h2>Joint tenancy agreements</h2>

                <p>When you sign&nbsp;a

                        joint tenancy agreement

                    each other. You are all equally responsible for keeping to the conditions of the agreement.</p>
            <p>If one person doesn't pay their share of the rent, the others have to pay it for them. As a group,
                each of you is responsible for making sure that the whole rent is paid.</p>
            <p>If one of you wants to leave and gives the landlord notice to end the agreement, it normally ends the
                agreement for everyone. Anyone who wants to stay could try to negotiate a new tenancy agreement with
                the landlord before the original one ends. This does not apply during a fixed-term tenancy agreement.</p>
