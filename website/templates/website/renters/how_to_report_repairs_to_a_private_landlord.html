            write to them or email them to confirm the details.</p>
        <p>If there's a dispute about repairs not being done, a letter or email helps show you told your

    <h2>Why you should report repairs</h2>
        <p>Your tenancy agreement might say that reporting repairs is a condition of your tenancy.</p>
        <p>If you don't report repairs when they're needed, a small problem could get worse and cost
            your landlord more to fix.</p>
        <p>Your landlord could

               title="see also: tenancy deposit deductions">deduct money from your tenancy deposit
            </a> or decide not to renew your tenancy.</p>

        <p>Problems with repairs or conditions in your home
        could also harm your health.</p>
