    <h2>Check who is responsible for repairs</h2>
        <p>Your council or housing association landlord is usually
            <a href="{% url 'renters-landlord_and_tenant_responsibilities_for_repairs' %}">
                responsible for doing repairs in your home</a>.</p>
        <p>If you caused damage to your home, you should still report it. Your landlord could arrange to fix the damage
            and then charge you for the cost of the repairs.</p>
        <p>Some small repairs to your home may be covered by the
            <a href="{% url 'renters-right_to_repair_for_council_tenants' %}"

    <h2>Contact your landlord</h2>
        <p>Always report repairs to your landlord as soon as you can.</p>
        <p>Most councils and housing associations allow you to report repairs online.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>You may be able to phone, email or write to your landlord with details of the repair instead.&nbsp;
            Check your landlord's website or your tenants' handbook for further information.</p>
        <p>If there's a dispute about repairs not being done, a letter or email helps prove you
            told your landlord about the problem</p>

    <h3>Reporting a repair on someone's behalf</h3>
        <p>You can usually report a repair on behalf of a council or housing association tenant.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You will need provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>their name</li>
            <li>their address</li>
            <li>information about the repair</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Ask how long the repair will take</h2>
        <p>Your landlord should tell you how they are going to carry out the repair and how long it will take.</p>
        <p>Reasonable time limits for completing repairs should be approximately:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>24 hours for an emergency repair (burst pipe or total loss of water supply)</li>
            <li>7 days for an urgent repair (leaking roof or blocked pipe)</li>
            <li>28 days for a routine repair (faulty window or broken extractor fan)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check your landlord's website or your tenants' handbook for further information about how long a repair might take.</p>

        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">
                    <a href="{% url 'contact' %}"><h4>Claim compensation for disrepair</h4></a>

                </div>

   <h2>Allow access</h2>
        <p>You must allow your landlord and their contractors reasonable access to your home.
            They will need to assess what repairs are needed and carry out the work.</p>
        <p>Your landlord should agree a time and date with you to do the repair. They will also tell you how
            long they will need access.</p>
        <p>Let your landlord know if you're no longer able to be home at the agreed time. Try to arrange another convenient time.</p>

   <h2>Keep records</h2>
        <p>Keep a record of your contact with your landlord about repair problems.</p>
        <p>This can include:</p>
   <ul>
        <li>copies of letters and emails you sent to your landlord</li>
        <li>the dates your landlord visited your home to check the repairs</li>
       <li>copies of letters and emails from your landlord</li>
       <li>date and time and details of phone calls between you and your landlord</li>
   </ul>

    <h2>Make a complaint</h2>
        <p>If your landlord refuses to do a repair, takes too long or does them badly, you can
