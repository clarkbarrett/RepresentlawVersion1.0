                <h2>What you can do if council or housing association repairs cause
                    problems or the work is done badly. </h2>
        </div>

        <h2>Staying in your home during repairs</h2>
        <p>You have the right to stay in the property while repairs are being carried out. The landlord should try
            to make sure there's not too much disruption.</p>
        <p>Some repairs might take longer and cost the landlord more because you are still in your home.
            The landlord cannot use this as an excuse to ask you to leave.</p>
        <p>Having repairs carried out means that you might have to put up with some disruption. You do not have
            the right to be rehoused while repairs are being completed.</p>
        <p>You do not have the right to stop paying the rent during repairs.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">If repairs to your home are very disruptive (for example,
            if some rooms are unusable) you can ask your landlord for a reduction on your rent.</p>

    <h2>Moving out during repairs</h2>
        <p>You may have to move out of your home if it needs major repairs or has been badly
            damaged in a fire or flood.</p>
        <p>Your landlord should provide you with alternative accommodation.</p>
        <p>Before you move out, ask your landlord about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>paying rent</li>
            <li>how much they will pay towards any extra costs you have, such as removal costs</li>
            <li>how long the work will take</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should also ask for your landlord's agreement in writing that you'll be able to move back to
            your home after repairs are finished.</p>

        <h2>Eviction during repair works</h2>
        <p>Your landlord can take court action to evict you if the repair works cannot be done unless you move out.</p>
        <p>If you are a council tenant
            or a secure housing association tenant, your landlord can only evict you if they can offer you
            suitable alternative accommodation. You can get a home loss payment if the move is permanent.</p>
        <p>If you are an
            <a href="{% url 'website:renters-eviction_of_assured_tenants' %}"
               title="See also: Eviction of housing association tenants">
                assured (or assured shorthold) housing association tenant</a>, a court can evict you if the
            housing association cannot carry out major repairs with you still in the property. The housing
            association does not have to offer you anywhere else to live if this happens.</p>

    <h2>Use of your electricity and gas</h2>
        <p>The landlord's workers probably have to use your electricity, gas and other services during repair works.</p>
        <p>If you think they have used too much or if it continues for a long time, ask your landlord if they can
            make a contribution towards your bills.</p>
    <h2>Responsibility for repair work</h2>
        <p>Your landlord must make sure that their repair work is
        carried out properly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The work should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>be completed within a reasonable time</li>
            <li>not cause other repair problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The landlord should also make sure that internal decorations and your personal belongings are not
            damaged.</p>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for repairing any damage caused by the disrepair or by the work to
            fix it.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For example, the landlord should repair any damaged plaster or wall coverings,
            repaint if needed and replace any damaged items such as carpets.</p>
