    <h2>Before you take action</h2>
        <p>Make sure you
            <a title="see also: reporting repairs and allowing access"
               href="{% url 'renters-how_to_report_repairs_to_a_social_landlord' %}">
                report the need for repairs</a> to your council or housing association and allow them a reasonable amount
            of time to do them. Most councils and housing associations carry out repairs once they know about them.</p>
        <p>You do not have the right to withhold&nbsp;&nbsp;rent payments if repairs aren't done.</p>
        <p>If you don't pay the rent, your landlord could take steps to evict you.</p>

    <h2>Use your landlord's complaints procedure</h2>
        <p>If you rent from the council, check your tenants' handbook or landlord's website for details of the
            complaints procedure.</p>
        <p>Housing associations and housing cooperatives should have a formal complaints procedure.</p>
        <p>You can use this if you're not happy about the condition of your home.</p>

    <h2>Complain to environmental health</h2>
        <p>You can ask the environmental health department to send someone to inspect your home for health and safety hazards.</p>

                complaining to environmental health</a>.</p>
        <p>Environmental health may be able to take enforcement action against your landlord if
            you are a housing association tenant.</p>
        <p>If you are a council tenant, they can give the council's housing department advice about what to do
            to improve conditions in your home.</p>
        <p>It's worth complaining as you can use any report provided as evidence for a complaint or legal action.</p>

    <h2>Complain to the Ombudsman</h2>
        <p>Complain to the Housing Ombudsman Service if you have gone through your landlord's
            complaints procedure and are not satisfied with the result.</p>

                complaining to the Housing Ombudsman Service</a>.</p>
        <p>If the ombudsman agrees with your complaint, they can recommend that your landlord takes
            steps to put things right. They may suggest that your landlord also pays you compensation.</p>
        <p>Most councils and housing associations take the steps the ombudsman suggests.</p>

    <h2>Consider legal action against your landlord</h2>
        <p>It may be possible to

            get your landlord to carry them out.</p>
        <p>Keep&nbsp;copies of any:</p>
