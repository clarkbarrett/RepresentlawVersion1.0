    <h2>Extra legal protection in shared housing</h2>
        <p>Your landlord usually has extra legal responsibilities if the home you rent is a house in
            multiple occupation or HMO.</p>
        <p>The extra rules are there to reduce the risk of fire and to make sure that people living
            in shared houses or flats have adequate facilities.</p>

    <h2>Extra responsibilities of HMO landlords</h2>
        <p>Landlords of HMOs must make sure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>proper fire safety measures are in place, including working smoke alarms</li>
            <li>annual

            <li>there are enough rubbish bins/bags</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Is your home a house in multiple occupation?</h2>
        <p>Your home is probably an HMO if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>three or more unrelated people live there as at least 2 separate households &ndash; for example,
                3 single people with their own rooms, or 2 couples each sharing a room</li>
            <li>the 3 or more people living there share basic amenities, such as a kitchen or bathroom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An HMO could be a:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>house split into separate bedsits</li>
            <li>shared house or flat, where the sharers are not members of the same family</li>
            <li>hostel</li><li>bed-and-breakfast hotel that is not just for holidays</li>
            <li>shared accommodation for students &ndash; although many&nbsp;

                    halls of residence</a> and other types of student accommodation owned by educational establishments
                are not classed as HMOs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ask
            <a title="link to Gov.uk - find your local council" href="{{ find_council_url }}" target="_blank"> your local council
            </a> to check if your home is registered as an HMO.</p>

    <h2>Responsibility for repairs in HMOs</h2>
        <p>Your landlord is responsible for any repairs to communal areas of your home.</p>
        <p>They are also responsible for repairs to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the structure and exterior of the house &ndash; including the walls, window frames and gutters</li>
            <li>water and gas pipes</li>
            <li>electrical wiring</li>
            <li>basins, sinks, baths and toilets</li>

     <h2>HMO licence for a shared home</h2>
        <p>Your landlord must get a licence from the council if the HMO:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>is at least 3 storeys high</li>
            <li>has 5 or more unrelated people live in it</li>
            <li>has 2 or more separate households living there</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some councils also require other HMOs to be licensed.&nbsp;Some councils require all private
            landlords to get a licence.</p>
        <p class="inline-callout highlight">Check with your&nbsp;
            <a title="Link to Gov.uk - find your local council"
               href="{{ find_council_url }}" target="_blank">local council</a>
            to find out if your landlord needs a licence and has obtained it.</p>
        <p>HMOs don't need to be licensed if they are managed or owned by a housing association or
            co-operative, a council, a health service or a police or fire authority.</p>
        <p>Licences usually last for 5 years but some councils grant them for shorter periods.
            When deciding whether to issue or renew a licence, the council checks that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the property meets an acceptable standard. For example, it looks at whether the property
                is large enough for the occupants and if it is well managed</li>
            <li>the landlord is a 'fit and proper' person</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Right to rent</h2>

        <p>From 1 February 2016, if you want to rent from a private landlord in England, the landlord must
            check that you have the 'right to rent'.</p>

     <h2>Landlord penalties for not having an HMO licence</h2>
        <p>If you live in a HMO that should be licensed but isn't, your landlord can be&nbsp;fined
            and&nbsp;ordered to repay up to 12 months' rent (or housing benefit to the council).</p>
        <p>Many people living in HMOs have an

               href="{% url 'website:renters-assured-shorthold-tenancies' %}">
                assured shorthold tenancy
            </a>.
            If you're an assured shorthold tenant and the HMO should be licensed but isn't, any section 21
            notice (two months' notice to leave) your landlord gives you is not valid.</p>

     <h2>How to complain about an HMO landlord</h2>
        <p>Contact the environmental health department of your&nbsp;
            <a title="Link to Gov.uk - find your local council" href="{{ find_council_url }}"
               target="_blank">local council
            </a>
            if you live in an HMO and you don't think your landlord is following these rules.</p>
        <p>The council can do an assessment using the Housing Health Safety Rating System. This assessment
            looks for specific hazards in the home. It allows councils to take action against landlords whose
            properties are not safe or fit to live in.</p>
        <p>The council can prosecute landlords of HMOs, or any manager they have employed, if they break the law.
            In extreme cases, the council can take over the management of the property.</p>
