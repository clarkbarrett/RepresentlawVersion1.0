        <p>
                Matrimonial and family issues can be a great cause of worry so it pays to have a skilful sympathetic
                lawyer working for you. Even if you are living together, in any partnership it is important to record
                your arrangements as this may save a great deal of anxiety and expense later on. We have a dedicated
                team committed to providing clear and proportionate advice. We understand the emotional and financial
                difficulties people face when a relationship breaks down. We know this is a worrying and stressful time
                and is particularly difficult if children are involved.
            </p>
